# Cricket-Dream-Team-Analyzer-Auction-Strategy-Player-Insights
This project is a comprehensive cricket analytics solution designed to assist with fantasy team creation, auction planning, and exploring player performance — blending data science with the passion for cricket.

The workflow begins with data collection through web scraping, where real-time player statistics and performance metrics are extracted from reliable cricket sources. Using Python, the raw data is then cleaned, structured, and transformed into a usable format. Key processes include handling missing values, standardizing player names, and computing custom metrics like strike rates, bowling economy, averages, and more.

Once the data is pre-processed, it is loaded into Power BI, where DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) is used to model relationships, create calculated columns, and define key performance indicators. Metrics such as batting consistency, bowling impact, and overall match influence are carefully crafted to ensure meaningful comparisons between players.

The final step involves designing an interactive Power BI dashboard. This dashboard allows users to:

  -> Build their dream team based on role-specific filters (batsmen, bowlers, all-rounders, wicketkeepers)

  -> Plan auction strategies by comparing player value and performance

  -> Analyze players across different teams, seasons, and formats

  -> Explore performance trends using intuitive visuals and slicers

  -> The project also integrates Excel and SQL for supplementary analysis and data storage during the pipeline. This ensures a smooth transition between raw data and visual 
        storytelling.

Whether you're a fantasy cricket enthusiast, a sports analyst, or just a fan curious about data, this project offers a powerful, fun, and insightful way to explore cricket statistics. It demonstrates the full data analytics lifecycle — from scraping and processing to modeling and visualization — making it an excellent showcase of both technical and domain-specific expertise.
