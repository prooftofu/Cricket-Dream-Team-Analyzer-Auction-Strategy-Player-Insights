Harshit Rana,KKR,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast,Bowler,"A fast bowler from Delhi, Harshit Rana is among the modern breed of players who made their IPL debut before their senior domestic debut. In his case, it was thanks to Kolkata Knight Riders' scouting system. With height, pace, hit-the-deck skills and clever variations to his credit, Harshit was fast-tracked into the India squad in July 2024, after having won the IPL with KKR."

Venkatesh Iyer,KKR,Left hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Allrounder,"A loose-limbed and tall pace-bowling allrounder, Venkatesh Iyer was briefly a much sought-after player in white-ball cricket for India. He had shone with both and ball as India searched for Hardik Pandya's back-up in the lead-up to the 2021 and 2022 T20 World Cups."

Alzarri Joseph,RCB,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast,Bowler,"Tall fast bowler Alzarri Joseph started out as a legspinner in his backyard in Antigua before his height marked him out for a different style of bowling. In his teens he gained a reputation as one of the fastest bowlers on the school circuit, which carried over into the 2016 Under-19 World Cup, where he bowled the competition's fastest delivery, a 147kph zinger that broke Zimbabwe batter Brendan Sly's stumps. Joseph would finish as West Indies' highest wicket-taker of the tournament, with 13 wickets from six games at an economy of 3.31."

Phil Salt,KKR,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Wicketkeeper Batter,"Phil Salt's fearless ball-striking at the top of the Sussex order earned him attention from across the global T20 circuit and a maiden England call-up in 2019, though he was made to wait until 2021 for his debut when he performed a passable impression of Jason Roy in the Covid-hit ODI series against Pakistan."
Glenn Maxwell,RCB,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Batting Allrounder,"One of the fastest scorers in world cricket, Glenn Maxwell has lit up the limited-overs formats. His ability to make unconventional shots - reverse sweeps and pulls, for example - appear routine makes it hard to set fields to cover all of his scoring areas. Maxwell's audacity comes with risk, and he can exasperate as well as exhilarate, but at his best he can change a game in moments. Also a handy offspinner and outstanding fielder, Maxwell offers an impressive package in one-day and T20 cricket when things click. "

Contracted to Western Australia as a schoolboy, he took 5 for 24 on first-class debut against Tasmania in February 2017 as a 17-year-old. He was selected initially for his bowling given his 200cm frame and his ability to deliver fast outswing but was plagued by stress fractures. However, throughout his junior days with Subiaco-Floreat and WA's junior teams his technically sound batting and an unquenchable thirst for scoring runs saw him emerge as a genuine allrounder of rare ability. "
Dinesh Karthik,RCB,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Wicketkeeper Batter,"Not many would forget the sight of Dinesh Karthik in India colours, horizontal on the ground, as he stumped Michael Vaughan in 2004. It was his first dismissal as a wicketkeeper for India, but his international career never really took off. Around the time he began churning out consistent runs in domestic cricket, India had MS Dhoni at the helm and behind the stumps, so there was very little Karthik could do. A man who was an integral part of a Test series victory over England in 2007, who showed he could open the batting in spicy conditions, just could not capitalise on his second chances. "

In 2017, he bagged an IPL contract worth INR 2.6 crore. Months later, he was wearing an India shirt and bowling in a T20 international against New Zealand. "

Naveen-ul-Haq,LSG,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium fast,Bowler,"A feisty fast bowler with a wide range of slower-ball variations, Naveen-ul-Haq first rose to prominence as a death-overs specialist, but soon developed his new-ball skills to become a useful weapon across phases. Like many of his compatriots, he is an in-demand commodity in franchise leagues across the world.
Born in Kabul, Naveen fled with his family to Pakistan in his early years, and began playing tape-ball cricket there. When they returned to Afghanistan, he began playing with a leather ball for the first time. He was so impressive for Afghanistan's Under-16 and Under-19 teams that his first professional match at the senior level was his ODI debut against Bangladesh, just two days after he turned 17.
Naveen made seven sporadic ODI appearances from his debut to January 2021, and a year later he took a break from the format to focus on the 2022 T20 World Cup. In the meantime, he became an integral part of Afghanistan's T20I side, either side of captaining Afghanistan to a fourth-place finish at the 2018 Under-19 World Cup.
Stints at the BPL, CPL, LPL and the T20 Blast followed as he began to build his reputation. In 2023, Naveen announced he would retire from ODIs after the World Cup that year. He took eight wickets as Afghanistan put in an impressive display in the competition, finishing sixth on the table.
By then, he had made his IPL debut as well, taking 11 wickets in his first season for Lucknow Super Giants, and was also in the news for an on-field altercation with Virat Kohli.
Towards the end of 2024, Naveen along with team-mates Fazalhaq Farooqi and Mujeeb-ur-Rahman got in trouble with the Afghanistan Cricket Board after they asked to be released from their central contracts so they could sign up for more franchise leagues. The board responded by revoking the players' NOCs and denying them further NOCs for the next two years. The situation was resolved with the board agreeing to grant them a limited number of NOCs and slapping them with financial penalties.
Naveen returned 14 wickets in IPL 2024, but it was in the T20 World Cup that year that he really shone. Naveen and Farooqi combined to take the spotlight away from Afghanistan's spinners as they made the semi-finals of a World Cup for the first time. Naveen finished the tournament with 13 wickets, and his three-wicket burst was one of the highlights of Afghanistan's first-ever victory over Australia in any format."

He was part of Australia's Under-19 World Cup team in South Africa 2020 but had to return home mid-tournament after being scratched by a monkey at a nature reserve on a day off.

Dushmantha Chameera,KKR,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast,Bowler,"Tall, slim and slippery, Dushmantha Chameera arrived at NCC in 2012, and was quickly marked out as a bowler for the future. First among his virtues is pace, generated from a slightly round-arm action that sacrifices movement. Capable of consistently hitting speeds of over 140 kph, coaches believe he had become the quickest bowler in the country by 23. He had played only a handful of games in his first two seasons, but came into his own in NCC's 2013-14 championship run, claiming 32 first-class cricket at 21.18."

In his first T20I over, he bowled Nasir Jamshed; with his first ODI delivery, he bowled Mohammad Hafeez; and in his first Test series he played a part in India's first whitewash win in a four-Test series, against Australia in 2013.Â "

His consistency earned him a place with the India A team in 2017 and a gigantic pay-day in the 2018 IPL auction when he was bought by Rajasthan Royals for INR 6.2 crore (USD 968000 approx) Amid those highlights was a bit of controversy as well when he took leave from the Duleep Trophy in 2017, citing illness, and was found a few days a later playing in the Karnataka Premier League. The BCCI pulled him out of the squad to play New Zealand A for actions that were a ""gross insult to the system""."
